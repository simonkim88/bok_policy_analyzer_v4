ES Activities and Labor Productivity:
Evidence from Korean Manufacturing Firms
This study empirically examines how firms’ environmental and social (E and
S) activities affect labor productivity using E and S metrics provided by the
Korea Corporate Governance Service (KCGS). Using a panel of listed firms over
2015–2023, we find that both the ES rating and the ES score are significantly and
negatively associated with labor productivity, which remains robust when we use
the overall ESG rating or the E and S pillar ratings. We further provide channel
evidence consistent with a cost-burden mechanism: firms with higher ES exhibit
a higher total operating cost ratio (TOCR), suggesting that the ES–productivity
relationship may be linked to operating cost pressure. Subcategory analyses
reveal heterogeneous pathways within ES. In the environmental category,
operational/management and communication-oriented activities are negatively
related to labor productivity, consistent with higher coordination and management
costs. In contrast, community engagement in the social category is positively
related to labor productivity, pointing to a complementary pathway through trust,
reputation, and relationship capital. Finally, firm- and industry-level analyses
indicate substantial heterogeneity in the ES–productivity relationship across firms
and industries. Overall, by combining cost-based channel evidence, subcategory-
level decompositions, and heterogeneity analyses, this study highlights that
evaluating the economic implications of sustainability initiatives requires
attention not only to aggregate ES/ESG metrics but also to cost structure, activity
types, and firm and industry characteristics.

ES Activities and Labor Productivity: Evidence from Korean Manufacturing Firms 1
I. Introduction
At the firm level, productivity is typically defined as output relative to
inputs and captures the overall efficiency with which multiple factors—
such as labor, capital, and land—are transformed into output. Productivity
can be measured using total factor productivity (TFP) or multifactor
productivity (MFP), but these measures require detailed data and involve
complex estimation and measurement procedures. By contrast, single-
factor productivity (SFP) relates output to a single input (e.g., labor or
capital), which makes it easier to compute and more comparable across firms,
industries, and countries. Among these measures, labor productivity—output
per unit of labor input—is the most widely used indicator of productive
efficiency (OECD, 2025). Prior studies (Fallahi et al., 2010; Laureti and
Viviani, 2011) emphasize that improvements in labor productivity are a key
determinant of firm competitiveness in domestic and international markets, in
part by lowering unit production costs. Moreover, labor productivity reflects
not only human-capital-related factors but also the influence of other inputs
and organizational efficiency, including physical capital, intangible assets,
production technology, and managerial organization (OECD, 2025).
Meanwhile, growing attention to climate change and broader environmental
challenges, as well as corporate social responsibility, has heightened the
importance of firms’ non-financial performance in addition to their financial
outcomes. Under the traditional shareholder-oriented view, firm performance
is primarily evaluated in terms of financial results that maximize shareholder
value. In contrast, stakeholder theory posits that firms should account for the
interests of a broader set of stakeholders—including employees, customers,
local communities, and the natural environment—rather than focusing
exclusively on shareholders. ESG1), an acronym for Environmental, Social,
1) ESG is widely understood to have originated from the United Nations Environment
Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI), launched in 2003, and to have gained broader
traction following the establishment of the United Nations Principles for Responsible
Investment (UN PRI) in 2006. As of end-August 2025, UNEP FI has more than 500
member institutions—including banks, insurers, and institutional investors—and supports
the financial sector in incorporating environmental and social sustainability considerations.

and Governance, summarizes firms’ sustainability-related non-financial
activities, and ESG ratings and scores are now widely used as investment-
screening metrics by global investors, including international investment
banks.2) A notable turning point was the 2020 annual letter by Larry Fink,
CEO of BlackRock, widely regarded as the world’s largest asset manager;
its assets under management are estimated to exceed USD 10 trillion as of
2025. The letter highlighted sustainability as a core investment consideration
and signaled a stronger stance toward fossil-fuel producers. Following the
COVID-19 pandemic, ESG investing has also been framed as part of a broader
reassessment of environmental degradation and as a potential source of new
growth in the context of economic recovery. Prior studies report increased
capital flows into firms with strong ESG performance and more favorable
market outcomes (Barrymore and Sampson, 2009; Khan, Serafeim, and Yoon,
2016; Nagy, Kassam, and Lee, 2016). Taken together, these developments
suggest that corporate ESG activities may enhance firm value by strengthening
nonfinancial performance and stakeholder relations.
However, it is important to assess how these sustainability-related activities
ultimately affect labor productivity, a key determinant of firms’ competitiveness.
Motivated by this concern, the present study investigates the relationship
between firms’ environmental and social (ES) activities and labor productivity in
the Korean manufacturing sector from multiple angles and draws policy-relevant
implications. We focus on ES as the primary explanatory variable because
governance-related (G) activities are more closely tied to internal control
systems and shareholder protection, implying mechanisms that differ from those
of E and S and are less directly linked to labor productivity. Accordingly, we
exclude G from our main analyses and use it primarily for robustness checks.
UN PRI, developed under UNEP FI as a set of principles for the asset management
and investment community, has more than 5,000 institutional investors as signatories and
promotes the integration of ESG factors into investment decision-making processes.
2) Bank of Korea also incorporates ESG considerations into its foreign reserve asset
management, for example by adopting a negative-screening approach that excludes
companies associated with ESG controversies, and is reviewing a longer-term shift toward
an ESG integration strategy that would more comprehensively embed ESG factors across
the portfolio.

ES Activities and Labor Productivity: Evidence from Korean Manufacturing Firms 3
The main empirical findings are as follows. First, in the full-sample
analysis, both the ES rating and the ES score are consistently and negatively
associated with labor productivity. This negative relationship remains after
controlling for key firm characteristics—such as firm size, capital intensity,
wages, and R&D—and is broadly robust to alternative ESG measures,
including the overall ESG rating and the E, S, and G pillar ratings. Second,
our channel analyses suggest that the negative ES–productivity relationship
may be linked to firms’ cost burden and the composition of ES activities.
Specifically, firms with higher ES exhibit a higher total operating cost ratio
(TOCR), and the negative ES coefficient is attenuated when TOCR is
included as a control variable. Moreover, when we decompose the ES score
into environmental and social subcategories, we find heterogeneous patterns:
operational/management and stakeholder-engagement components in the
environmental category are negatively related to labor productivity, whereas
community engagement in the social category is positively related. Third,
the productivity effects of ES vary across firms and industries. In interaction
models, the adverse association of ES is partially mitigated under certain
financial conditions, and industry-level analyses show pronounced negative
effects in selected manufacturing industries—such as paper, metals, and
electronic components—while the relationship is not statistically significant in
major export industries or in high greenhouse-gas-emitting sectors.
Relative to prior studies that focus primarily on aggregate ESG ratings
or a single pillar, this study provides a more comprehensive assessment of
how firms’ ES activities relate to labor productivity. We jointly consider (i)
both ES ratings and continuous ES scores, (ii) channel evidence based on the
total operating cost ratio (TOCR), (iii) decompositions of the environmental
(E) and social (S) pillars into detailed subcategories, and (iv) heterogeneity
across firms and industries. In particular, the TOCR-based analysis and
the subcategory decomposition together suggest that the ES–productivity
relationship is not a single uniform effect but may operate through cost
burdens and activity-specific pathways. By incorporating continuous score
data, we also capture variation that may be limited in rating-based measures

and provide additional robustness checks. Finally, by documenting that ES
effects can differ by firm characteristics and industry environments, we offer
policy-relevant implications: effective policy design may require approaches
tailored to industry and firm conditions rather than uniform prescriptions.
Overall, our approach contributes empirical evidence that helps clarify the
mechanisms through which sustainability-related activities may be linked to
productivity.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews
the related literature. Section III describes the data. Section IV presents the
empirical results. Section V concludes.
II. Literature Review
Corporate ESG activities can affect labor productivity through multiple
channels, with potentially positive or negative aspects. On the positive
side, strong environmental and social practices may enhance employees’
social identity3) and strengthen job satisfaction and mutual ties within the
workplace. These improvements can foster knowledge sharing, innovation, and
organizational efficiency, ultimately raising labor productivity (Turban and
Greening, 1997; Jones and Volpe, 2011; Delmas and Pekovic, 2012). Firms with
superior social and environmental performance may also build a reputation
as desirable employers, facilitating recruitment and increasing the likelihood
of attracting higher-quality workers. Such employees may exhibit greater
job satisfaction and align more closely with the firm’s values, which can
translate into higher effort and, in turn, improved labor productivity (Ambec
and Lanoie, 2008; Brekke and Nyborg, 2008; Wagner, 2011; Barrymore and
Sampson, 2021). In addition, appropriately designed environmental standards
and innovation in production processes can reduce production costs and
improve factor productivity, thereby strengthening firm competitiveness (Porter
3) Originally developed by social psychologists Henri Tajfel and John Turner, social identity
refers to an individual’s self-concept—shaping self-esteem, attitudes, and behaviors—that
arises from perceived membership in a particular social group.

and van der Linde, 1995; Delmas and Montiel, 2009; Alberti, 2013; Ma et al.,
2020). Finally, as investors increasingly incorporate ESG considerations into
investment decisions, firms with strong environmental and corporate social
responsibility (CSR) performance may obtain external financing at lower cost
(Bassen et al., 2006; Atan et al., 2017).
On the other hand, strengthening firms’ environmental and social
management may adversely affect labor productivity if it diverts key inputs—
such as capital, labor, raw materials, and energy—away from core production
processes toward non-core activities (Jaffe et al., 1995; Becker, 2011; Jackson
et al., 2014). Large-scale investments and the adoption of new production
technologies to comply with stringent environmental standards may also
reduce organizational flexibility, potentially undermining labor productivity
and competitiveness (Aguilera-Caracuel and Ortiz-de-Mandojana, 2013;
Lannelongue et al., 2017). In addition, environmental management often
entails additional expenditures, and firms may face heightened uncertainty and
risk stemming from changes in environmental regulation and related policies
(Walley and Whitehead, 1994; Hoffmann et al., 2009).
The empirical literature on the relationship between firms’ ESG (or
broader environmental and social) performance and labor productivity
remains largely inconclusive. Below, we summarize a set of studies reporting
positive associations. Goss and Roberts (2011), using U.S. firms over 1991–
2006, examine the link between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and loan
pricing and find that firms with stronger CSR obtain loans at lower interest
rates. This can be interpreted as a reduction in financing costs and may, in
turn, support productivity improvements. Delmas and Pekovic (2012), based
on a cross-section of more than 5,000 French firms in 2006, report that firms
adopting environmental standards such as ISO 140014) exhibit higher labor
productivity than non-adopters. Atan et al. (2017), analyzing 54 Malaysian
firms over 2010–2013, find that higher ESG scores are associated with a lower

cost of capital, although the separate effects of the E, S, and G components
are not statistically significant. Barrymore and Sampson (2021), using U.S.
firms over 2008–2018, document that the ESG–labor productivity relationship
varies by industry and is positive for larger firms. Kalantzis and Niczyporuk
(2022), examining more than 15,000 firms across the EU-27 and the United
Kingdom over 2018–2019, find that investments in within-firm energy
effciency increase labor productivity, potentially by improving the quality of
machinery and equipment and enhancing working conditions. Finally, Deng et
al. (2023), using 2,833 listed Chinese firms over 2016–2020, show that stronger
ESG performance is associated with higher total factor productivity.
However, a number of studies report negative or mixed findings. Becker
(2011), analyzing manufacturing plants in the United States, finds that higher
environmental compliance costs are associated with lower labor productivity,
although the effect is not statistically significant. Lannelongue et al. (2017),
using a sample of 2,823 plants located in 23 European Economic Area (EEA)
countries in 2014, document a negative relationship between environmental
performance and labor productivity. They further examine moderating effects
by interacting environmental performance with capital intensity and show
that the negative association is stronger for more capital-intensive plants—
that is, labor productivity declines more in plants with higher environmental
performance (e.g., lower CO₂ emissions) when capital intensity is high. Ma
et al. (2020), studying Chinese manufacturing firms in 2016, also report that
environmental management is negatively related to labor productivity, and
that quality management—proxied by adoption of ISO 90015)—attenuates
this negative relationship. More recently, Kim and Lee (2025) analyzed
the relationship between ESG performance and corporate productivity for
Korean listed firms over the period 2006–2021. The results show that neither
the overall ESG composite score nor the individual E and S scores have
statistically significant effects on total factor productivity. In contrast, the

E score has a statistically significant negative effect on labor productivity—
measured as total revenue divided by labor costs—whereas the S score and the
G score have statistically significant positive effects.
III. Data
To empirically examine the effect of firms’ ES activities on labor
productivity in the Korean manufacturing sector, we construct our dataset
by merging two main databases. ES-related measures are obtained from firm-
level environmental (E) and social (S) ratings and detailed assessment scores
published annually by the Korea Corporate Governance Service (KCGS).
Financial statements and other firm characteristics are drawn from DataGuide.
Our analysis sample includes only firm-year observations that are available in
both data sources.
KCGS has reported annual pillar ratings for E, S, and G as well as an
overall ESG rating since 2011. The ratings take six ordered categories6)—A+
(excellent), A (very good), B+ (good), B (fair), C (weak), and D (very weak)—
which we convert into a numeric scale from 1 to 6 (A+ = 6, A = 5, B+ = 4,
B = 3, C = 2, D = 1). ES_rating is constructed as the simple average of the
numeric E and S ratings. In addition to letter grades, KCGS computes detailed
pillar scores on a 0–100 scale each year. Unlike the ratings, these scores are
not publicly disclosed and are provided only on a restricted basis for research
purposes. Specifically, ES_rating is a publicly disclosed ordinal measure that
provides an intuitive benchmark for comparing firms’ relative ES performance,
whereas ES_score is an internally assessed continuous measure that can
capture finer-grained variation that may not be reflected in the discrete rating
scale. We therefore conduct analyses using both rating-based and score-
based ES measures to assess the robustness of our findings regarding the ES–
6) KCGS ratings are classified into seven categories—S, A+, A, B+, B, C, and D. In
manufacturing, however, there are no observations rated S in our sample. Accordingly,
we exclude the S category and work with the remaining six rating grades in the empirical
analysis.

productivity relationship. The sample period is set to 2015–2023, during which
the ESG data exhibit greater stability and time-series consistency.
We include a standard set of firm-level financial controls that are
commonly related to labor productivity, including firm size, capital intensity,
firm age, labor costs, R&D, leverage, and profitability. The dependent variable
is firm-level labor productivity. Following the literature, we measure labor
productivity as the natural logarithm of value added per employee (Jensen et
al., 2001; Zwick, 2004; Salis and Williams, 2010; Delmas and Pekovic, 2013;
Kalantzis and Niczyporuk, 2022) and, alternatively, the natural logarithm of
sales per employee (Ichniowski, 1990; Koch and McGrath, 1996; Fallahi et
al., 2010; Lannelongue et al., 2017; Barrymore and Sampson, 2021). Sales are
readily available, but they embed intermediate input costs (e.g., raw materials
and intermediate goods), which can limit their ability to capture the firm’s net
economic contribution. To address this concern, we treat value added as our
primary measure while also reporting results based on sales. Firm-level value
added is constructed following the methodology of the Korea Productivity
Center (KPC) and includes operating profit, labor income (including wages,
retirement benefits, and employee welfare expenses), depreciation, allowance
for doubtful accounts, and taxes and dues.7) Ideally, the denominator would be
hours worked at the firm level; however, due to data availability constraints,
we use the number of employees.8)
Labor productivity is more directly connected to environmental and social
(E and S) dimensions—such as environmental effciency, working conditions,
and human resource management—whereas governance (G) is largely
characterized by more indirect features, including internal control systems and
7) The value-added measure of Korea Productivity Center (KPC) is constructed using listed-
firm financial statement data, and information from the manufacturing cost statement
are not available, which limits our ability to estimate value added with full precision. To
compensate for this, we also report results using an alternative labor productivity measure
based on sales.
8) Both the OECD and the International Labour Organization (ILO) compile labor
productivity statistics based on value added per unit of labor input. In Korea, the Korea
Productivity Center (KPC) regularly produces offciallaborproductivityindicatorsby
sector and by industry, reporting both value added per labor input and an index of
industrial labor productivity. (https://www.kpc.or.kr)

shareholder rights protection. Accordingly, following common practice in the
literature, we use an ES measure that combines only environmental and social
performance as our primary explanatory variable (Deng et al., 2013; Lins et
al., 2017; Dyck et al., 2019; Choi and Jeong, 2025). This choice is intended to
more clearly isolate the ESG components that are most directly relevant for
labor productivity.9)
To appropriately account for firm characteristics that may affect labor
productivity, we include a set of financial and structural factors. Firm size is a
standard control variable in productivity studies, and prior research documents
that larger firms tend to be more productive, potentially reflecting economies
of scale (Koch and McGrath, 1996; Zwick, 2004; Laureti and Viviani, 2011;
Ma et al., 2020). We proxy firm size by the natural logarithm of total assets
and expect a positive coefficient. Capital intensity captures the amount of
physical capital used per unit of labor input; higher capital intensity implies
greater availability of machinery and equipment per worker and is therefore
expected to be positively related to labor productivity. Following Fallahi et
al. (2010), we measure capital intensity as the natural logarithm of tangible
fixed assets per employee. For robustness checks, we also use an alternative
measure that includes intangible assets, with similar results. Firm age may
also influence productivity in either direction (Jensen et al., 2001; Ma et al.,
2020). Older firms may benefit from accumulated experience and learning-
by-doing, whereas younger firms can be more productive in industries with
rapid technological change. We use the natural logarithm of firm age, and the
expected sign can be positive or negative.
Wage levels paid to workers can materially affect firm productivity (Fallahi
et al., 2010; Delmas and Pekovic, 2013). Higher average wages may reflect
a more skilled workforce and can raise productivity by improving worker
motivation and reducing turnover. Conversely, wage increases that exceed
marginal productivity may impose additional cost burdens. To accommodate
9) For the main specifications, we also re-estimate the models using the overall ESG measure
in place of ES. The results are reported in Table 3 and remain robust across additional
specifications.

10 BOK Working Paper No. 2026-6
these competing effects, we use the natural logarithm of average wage per
employee, and the expected sign is ambiguous. Innovation is another key
determinant of production efficiency (Schumpeter, 1934; Kurt and Kurt,
2001). Following Ma et al. (2020), we measure the degree of innovation by an
R&D ratio, defined as R&D expenses scaled by total assets. Because more
active innovation is likely to enhance productive efficiency, we expect a
positive coeffcient. From the perspective of financial structure, leverage may
have offsetting effects on productivity (Kalantzis and Niczyporuk, 2022; Deng
et al., 2023; Lan et al., 2024; Kim and Lee, 2025). Moderate use of debt can
support expansion and the realization of scale economies, whereas excessive
leverage can reduce productivity through higher interest expenses and tighter
financing constraints. Accordingly, the expected sign of leverage—measured
as total liabilities divided by total equity—is not clear ex ante. Finally,
profitability (ROA) can provide an important foundation for productivity
improvements. More profitable firms may strengthen efficiency and
productivity by expanding capital investment and increasing R&D spending.
Following Laureti and Viviani (2011) and Lan et al. (2024), we proxy
profitability using net income scaled by total assets and expect a positive sign.
Our final sample consists of firms in the manufacturing sector—defined
as KSIC 2-digit industries with codes 10–34—for which ESG assessments are
available. The resulting panel includes 4,138 firm-year observations. Table 1
reports summary statistics for the main variables.10) The labor productivity
measures and ESG-related variables exhibit reasonable distributions in the
sample, and most financial variables fall within ranges comparable to those
documented in prior studies. Labor productivity displays substantial cross-firm
heterogeneity, and firm characteristics such as asset size, capital intensity, and
profitability also show meaningful dispersion, supporting an empirical analysis
of productivity determinants. Overall, the sample covers manufacturing firms
with diverse scales and financial structures, providing suffcient variation to
examine the relationship between ESG activities and productivity.

IV. Empirical Results
1. Baseline Regression Analyses
This section examines the relationship between ES activities and labor
productivity through a sequence of descriptive and regression analyses. Section
4.1.1 first illustrates how the ES–productivity relationship changes depending
on whether firm size is controlled for. Sections 4.1.2 and 4.1.3 then assess
whether this pattern remains consistent in the baseline ES regressions and in
comparative specifications using alternative measures, including the E, S, and
G pillar ratings as well as the integrated ESG ratings.

1.1. Univariate Test
To provide descriptive evidence on the relationship between labor
productivity and ES measures, we first present a simple comparison without
controlling for firm size (Figure 1). We then examine whether a similar pattern
persists after removing the size component in advance (Figure 2). Because ES
is typically strongly correlated with firm size, contrasting the size-unadjusted
and size-adjusted comparisons is informative for isolating the underlying ES–
productivity relationship.
Panel A of Figure 1 compares mean labor productivity across groups defined
by the discrete ES rating. Firms are classified into three categories: Low (ES_
Rating ≤ 2, corresponding to grades C and D), Middle (ES_Rating = 3,
grade B), and High (ES_Rating ≥ 4, grades B+, A, and A+). The number
of observations in each group is 1,734 (Low), 1,610 (Middle), and 794 (High),
indicating that the High group contains substantially fewer observations than
the other two groups. The x-axis indicates the year, and the y-axis shows the
group-specific mean of labor productivity measured by natural logarithm of
value added per employee (LP_VA). The unconditional comparison shows
that firms with higher ES ratings tend to exhibit higher labor productivity.
Panel B constructs ES_score as the average of the environmental (E) and
social (S) scores (0–100) and partitions firms into terciles based on this
continuous measure. As a result, the three groups are approximately balanced,
with about 1,380 observations per tercile. Consistent with Panel A, mean
labor productivity increases with ES_score. However, these patterns do not
take into account the strong correlation between ES and firm size. Given that
high-ES firms are typically larger and have greater resource capacity, the
relationship may differ once firm size is controlled for.

Figure 2 compares differences in the labor productivity across ES groups
after purging the effect of firm size (Size) from labor productivity. Specifically,
we regress labor productivity on firm size and compute the resulting residuals,
which are then plotted by ES group. The size-adjusted patterns differ
markedly from those in Figure 1. In Panel A, once the size component is
removed, the high-ES group exhibits lower productivity on average, reversing
the unconditional pattern shown in Panel A of Figure 1. Panel B yields a

similar reversal when ES_score is used. These findings suggest that, after
accounting for firm size, the relationship between ES and labor productivity
may be weak or even negative. The fact that the simple comparisons produce
opposite patterns before and after the size adjustment underscores the
importance of more rigorous empirical strategies—controlling for firm size and
incorporating fixed effects—in the subsequent regression analyses.

1.2. Baseline Regression
To more rigorously assess the effect of ES activities on labor productivity,
this section estimates panel regression models that include industry and year
fixed effects. Our baseline specification is as follows.
Our primary dependent variable is labor productivity based on value
added (LP_VA), and we additionally report results using sales-based
labor productivity (LP_Sales) as a robustness check. The key explanatory
variable captures the level of firms’ ES activities. Throughout the main
analyses, we use ES_rating and also present results based on the continuous
assessment measure, ES_score. As control variables, we include the seven
firm characteristics described in the data section: Size, CapIntensity, Age,
Salary, R&D, Leverage, and ROA. To mitigate endogeneity concerns arising
from contemporaneous correlations and potential reverse causality, we follow
standard practice and use one-period lagged values (t−1) for the explanatory
and control variables. We further include industry fixed effects, α , defined at
k(i)
the KSIC 2-digit level, and year fixed effects, τ. All statistical inferences are
t
based on heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors clustered at the firm level.
Table 2 reports regression estimates of the effect of the ES rating on labor
productivity. Columns (1) and (2) present results for manufacturing firms

the broader sample excluding the financial sector. The dependent variable is
value-added-based labor productivity (LP_VA) in columns (1) and (3) and
sales-based labor productivity (LP_Sales) in columns (2) and (4).
In the manufacturing firm sample, the coefficient on ES_rating is
−0.0623 in column (1) and −0.0650 in column (2), both statistically significant
at the 5% and 1% levels, respectively. This implies that firms with higher
ES ratings—i.e., those evaluated more favorably on environmental and social
dimensions—exhibit lower labor productivity conditional on the included

controls and fixed effects. This finding contrasts with the unconditional
patterns in Figure 1, where higher ES is associated with higher productivity,
and it is broadly consistent with the size-adjusted evidence in Figure 2, which
suggests an inverse relationship once the size component is removed. In other
words, for manufacturing firms, the negative association between ES and
productivity persists in the multivariate regressions. The estimated coeffcients
on the controls are also intuitive. In column (1), Size, CapIntensity, and Salary
all enter with strongly positive coefficients, consistent with prior evidence
that productivity tends to be higher in larger firms, in firms with greater
physical capital per worker, and in firms paying higher wages. R&D and ROA
are likewise positively and significantly associated with productivity, indicating
that more innovative and more profitable firms tend to exhibit higher labor
productivity.
The negative relationship remains when we expand the industry coverage
from manufacturing firms to the broader sample of non-financial firms. In
columns (3) and (4), the coefficient on ES_rating is −0.1290 and −0.1021,
respectively, both statistically significant at the 1% level. Notably, the
magnitudes are larger in absolute value than those in the manufacturing
subsample, indicating that the inverse ES–productivity relationship is even
more pronounced across a wider set of industries. While the simple mean
comparisons in Figure 1 suggest higher productivity among high-ES firms—
largely because such firms tend to be larger—once we control for key firm
characteristics, including size, capital intensity, wage levels, and profitability,
ES rating continues to exhibit a consistently negative association with
labor productivity. This pattern is robust to expanding the sample beyond
manufacturing firms.11)
11) Using the same empirical framework as in Table 2, we replace the ES rating with the
continuous ES score (ES_score). The results are reported in Appendix A.2 and confirm
that our findings are robust.

1.3. Comparisons of ESG and E, S, G components
Table 3 compares the effects of the overall ESG rating and its individual
pillars—environment (E), social (S), and governance (G)—on labor
productivity. Columns (1)–(8) sequentially include ESG_rating, E_rating, S_
rating, and G_rating. All specifications control for firm characteristics and
include industry and year fixed effects, allowing us to assess the association
between each ESG component and productivity net of observable firm
heterogeneity and common time- and industry-level shocks. In columns (1)
and (5), where the overall ESG rating is used, we again find a consistently
negative relationship between ESG and labor productivity. This mirrors the
estimates based on ES in Table 2 and indicates that our main conclusion is
unchanged when replacing the ES measure with the overall ESG rating.
In columns (2) and (6), where only the environmental (E) rating is
included, the negative association becomes more pronounced. Among the ESG
pillars, the E component shows the most consistent inverse relationship with
labor productivity. One potential interpretation is that environmental efforts—
such as compliance with regulations, emissions abatement, and improvements
in energy effciency—may entail higher costs in the short run, which can be
reflected in lower measured productivity. In this sense, the negative ESG–
productivity association appears to be driven primarily by the environmental
pillar. As shown in columns (3) and (7), the social (S) rating is also negatively
related to labor productivity, although the estimates are weaker in statistical
significance than those for E. This may reflect the heterogeneous nature of
social activities—covering areas such as employee welfare, working conditions,
and diversity—whose productivity implications can vary across firms. By
contrast, in columns (4) and (8), the governance (G) rating does not exhibit a
clear relationship with labor productivity. Because governance largely captures
more indirect and longer-term features such as risk management and internal
controls, it may be less tightly linked to short-run productivity measures.
Overall, the G pillar does not appear to be a primary driver of productivity
variation in our setting.

--- 페이지 25 ---
ES Activities and Labor Productivity: Evidence from Korean Manufacturing Firms 19
In sum, the estimates in Table 3 (columns (1)–(8)) indicate that the ESG
pillars are related to labor productivity in different ways. The overall ESG rating,
as well as the environmental (E) and social (S) components, are consistently
negatively associated with productivity after controlling for firm characteristics
and fixed effects, whereas the governance (G) component exhibits limited
and less systematic relationships. These results suggest that, for productivity
analysis, it is more informative to move beyond a single aggregate ESG measure
and to consider its underlying components separately. They also provide
supporting justification for our focus on the ES measure in the main analysis.

2. Channel Evidence
This section provides evidence on potential mechanisms through which the
baseline negative ES–labor productivity relationship may arise. Specifically,
Section 4.2.1 examines a firm-level cost mechanism based on firms’ cost
structure, while Section 4.2.2 investigates an ES activity-level mechanism by
decomposing ES into its underlying subcomponents.
2.1. Firm-level cost channel: Total operating cost ratio
This subsection examines whether a cost-burden mechanism may help
explain the negative association between ES activities and labor productivity.
To capture firms’ operating cost burden, we use the total operating cost ratio
(TOCR), defined as (cost of goods sold plus selling, general and administrative
expenses) divided by sales, i.e., (COGS + SG&A)/Sales. Because TOCR
jointly reflects production costs (COGS) and operating/administrative costs
(SG&A), it provides a useful summary measure for assessing whether ES
activities are linked to firms’ cost structure in ways that may translate into
lower short-run productivity.
Panel A of Table 4 examines whether firms with stronger ES performance
exhibit a higher operating cost burden. In column (1), ES_rating is positively
and statistically significantly associated with TOCR, suggesting that firms
with higher ES ratings may incur higher total operating costs relative to sales.
A key consideration is that ROA is mechanically and accounting-wise closely
related to TOCR, because profits are calculated after subtracting major cost
components, including COGS and SG&A. Including such a performance
measure in the TOCR equation can therefore constitute overcontrol by
partialling out variation that is inherently tied to the cost structure through
which ES activities may operate. Accordingly, we present the specification
without ROA as the baseline. When ROA is additionally controlled for, the
coefficient on ES_rating becomes smaller and loses statistical significance
(column (2)), consistent with the notion that ROA absorbs a substantial
portion of the variation in operating cost burden.

--- 페이지 27 ---
ES Activities and Labor Productivity: Evidence from Korean Manufacturing Firms 21
Panel B of Table 4 examines how the ES–productivity relationship changes
when TOCR is added to the labor productivity regressions. TOCR is strongly
negatively associated with labor productivity, indicating that firms with a
higher operating cost burden tend to exhibit lower productivity (column (2)).
Moreover, once TOCR is included, the estimated coefficient on ES_rating
remains negative but its statistical significance weakens (column (3)). This
pattern suggests that part of the negative ES–productivity relationship may be
linked to firms’ operating cost burden, providing indirect evidence consistent
with the view that ES activities can entail higher costs in the short run.

This table presents the regression estimates of the total operating cost
ratio (TOCR) on ES_rating (Panel A) and labor productivity on ES_rating,

2.2. ES activity channel: Subcategory analysis
Section 4.2.1 shows that the negative ES–labor productivity relationship
may be closely linked to firms’ operating cost burden, as proxied by the total
operating cost ratio (TOCR). However, TOCR is a broad cost measure that
aggregates cost of goods sold and SG&A expenses. As such, evidence that ES
is associated with higher overall costs does not, by itself, identify which types
of ES activities are most directly connected to these cost increases and the
accompanying productivity constraints. ES activities are not a single policy
or investment item; rather, they comprise heterogeneous components—such
as strategy formulation, internal governance and operational management
systems, stakeholder engagement, and performance implementation. It is
therefore plausible that the adverse ES–productivity association is not uniform
across ES components, but instead is more tightly related to activities with
higher coordination and managerial requirements, including operational
management and stakeholder-facing efforts, which may bear more immediate
resource and organizational burdens. Motivated by this view, we decompose
the KCGS environmental (E) and social (S) measures into subcategories and
reinterpret the ES–productivity relationship at the specific activity level.12)
Because subcategory information is available only as continuous scores rather
than discrete ratings, we use ES_score (instead of ES_rating) to ensure
comparability across the subcategory measures.13)
Turning to the environmental (E) subcategories in Panel A of Table 5,
the overall E score continues to be associated with labor productivity in a
predominantly negative direction, consistent with the earlier results. When
we decompose E into subcomponents, the negative association appears to
12) Descriptions of the environmental (E) and social (S) subcategories are provided in
Appendix A.3.
13) The subcategory structure of the KCGS environmental (E) and social (S) measures has
changed over time. For the E pillar, the framework shifted from five subcategories in 2011–
2018 to three subcategories in 2019–2021, and was then reorganized into four subcategories
from 2022 onward. The S pillar also underwent a revision: it consisted of four subcategories
through 2021 but expanded to nine subcategories beginning in 2022. To maintain
consistency in the number and definition of subcategories across our sample period, we
conduct the subcategory analysis using the original framework—five E subcategories and
four S subcategories.

--- 페이지 30 ---
24 BOK Working Paper No. 2026-6
be concentrated in subcategories with a more operational and managerial
orientation. In particular, E. Governance Structure, E. Management, and
E. Stakeholder Engagement display consistently negative relationships with
labor productivity. This pattern is consistent with the idea that practical,
implementation-oriented activities—such as establishing environmental
governance systems, managing environmentally friendly production and supply
chains, and engaging in stakeholder communication—may impose additional
managerial and operational burdens in the short run that are linked to the
negative labor productivity. By contrast, more structural and longer-horizon
dimensions such as E. Strategy and E. Performance exhibit more limited and
less systematic associations with labor productivity. This suggests that some
environmental efforts may contribute to longer-term risk management or
efficiency improvements, but may not translate immediately into short-run
labor productivity measures.
Panel B, which reports results for the social (S) subcategories, also
highlights meaningful heterogeneity within ES activities. While the overall S
score retains a consistently negative sign, the subcategory-level estimates reveal
divergent patterns. The coefficients on S. Employees, S. Supply Chain and S.
Market Relations, and S. Customer Relations are not statistically significant,
indicating no clear association with labor productivity for these dimensions.
In contrast, S. Community Engagement stands out with a positive and
statistically significant relationship. This finding is consistent with the
possibility that efforts to strengthen ties with local communities and undertake
social contribution initiatives may enhance firm reputation, customer trust,
and internal cohesion, which can in turn be associated with higher labor
productivity.
Overall, the subcategory decomposition suggests that the negative ES–
labor productivity relationship is unlikely to reflect a uniform adverse effect
of ES as a whole; rather, it may arise through specific types of activities. In
particular, the consistently negative associations for operational, managerial,
and stakeholder-facing environmental activities—such as governance structure,
management, and stakeholder engagement—link naturally to the cost-burden

--- 페이지 31 ---
ES Activities and Labor Productivity: Evidence from Korean Manufacturing Firms 25
evidence in Section 4.2.1, in that these activities may raise coordination and
managerial costs in the short run and thereby make the labor productivity
worse. By contrast, the positive association for social-community engagement
indicates that some ES activities may operate through compensating channels,
such as strengthening trust, reputation, and relational capital, potentially
buffering or offsetting short-run productivity deterioration. Taken together,
the effects of ES activities on labor productivity appear heterogeneous across
subcomponents, with cost-intensive operational efforts and relationship-
building activities potentially operating simultaneously.

3. Heterogeneity Analyses
The impacts of ES activities on labor productivity are unlikely to be
uniform across firms. Accordingly, this section examines whether the ES–
productivity relationship varies systematically with firm and industry
characteristics by conducting heterogeneity analyses. Specifically, Section 4.3.1
introduces interaction terms between ES and key firm characteristics to assess
differential effects across firms, and Section 4.3.2 estimates industry-specific
regressions to evaluate cross-industry differences in the ES–labor productivity
relationship.

--- 페이지 34 ---
28 BOK Working Paper No. 2026-6
3.1. Interaction Effects between ES and Firm Characteristics
Firms differ in capital structure, innovative capacity, and financial
conditions, and such differences can shape how ES activities are implemented
and incorporated into managerial decision-making. As a result, the ES–labor
productivity relationship may exhibit heterogeneity, in the sense that the
association can be amplified or attenuated depending on firm characteristics.
To examine this possibility, we estimate regression models that include
interaction terms between the ES rating and key firm attributes.
Table 6 reports the results from these interaction specifications. The
interaction terms are constructed using capital intensity (CapIntensity), R&D
ratio (R&D), leverage (Leverage), and profitability (ROA). All models include
the full set of firm-level controls as well as industry and year fixed effects. Across
sp ecifications, the coeffcient on ES_rating remains negative, indicating that
the baseline pattern—higher ES is associated with lower labor productivity—
persists even after allowing the relationship to vary with firm characteristics. In
other words, our main finding is largely unchanged in the augmented models,
providing additional evidence of robustness.
In column (2), which interacts ES with capital intensity, the baseline
ES effect becomes substantially less statistically significant, suggesting that
the ES–productivity relationship is not fully stable across different levels of
capital intensity. Although the interaction term itself does not exhibit a clear
or robust pattern, the attenuation of the main ES coeffcient indicates that
differences in firms’ capital structure may partially dilute the measured ES–
productivity association. In column (3), where we allow the ES effect to vary
with R&D ratio, the statistical significance of the baseline ES coefficient
similarly weakens, and the interaction term is not statistically significant.
Taken together, these results imply that the ES–productivity relationship does
not vary in a systematic way with firms’ innovation level, and that R&D does
not appear to be a consistent moderator that either amplifies or mitigates the
effect.

--- 페이지 35 ---
ES Activities and Labor Productivity: Evidence from Korean Manufacturing Firms 29
By contrast, column (4), which introduces the interaction between ES
and leverage, yields an interaction term that is weakly positive. This suggests
that the negative association between ES activities and productivity may be
attenuated among more highly levered firms. One possible interpretation is
that, for firms facing tighter financial constraints, ESG-related efforts can play
a complementary role in strengthening external stakeholder confidence and
easing financing frictions, thereby partially offsetting the adverse productivity
effect. In column (5), where ES is interacted with profitability (ROA), the
interaction term is consistently positive. This implies that the negative ES–
productivity association is substantially weaker for more profitable firms.
Firms with stronger profitability may be better positioned to absorb the
resource demands associated with environmental and social initiatives, so that
any short-run increases in operating burdens are less likely to be passed on to
labor productivity. Overall, these results indicate that financial conditions can
meaningfully shape the extent to which ES activities are associated with labor
productivity.
Overall, the interaction analysis indicates that our main finding—
a negative association between ES ratings and labor productivity—largely
persists in augmented specifications that allow the relationship to vary with
firm characteristics. At the same time, leverage and profitability emerge
as meaningful moderators: higher leverage and stronger profitability are
associated with a weaker negative ES–productivity relationship. These results
suggest that the economic implications of ESG-related activities should be
interpreted in light of firms’ financial structure and managerial capacity, and
that the ES–productivity association can differ systematically across firms.

3.2. Industry-Level Analyses
The preceding analysis establishes the ES–labor productivity relationship
in the full sample, but the average association may mask substantial
heterogeneity across industries. Because industries differ markedly in
production technologies, energy use, workforce composition, and regulatory
environments, the costs and operational constraints associated with ES
activities can vary by industry. To assess such cross-industry heterogeneity, we
conduct industry-level analyses of the ES–productivity relationship. Detailed
results for all manufacturing industries at the KSIC 2-digit level are reported
in Appendix A.4. In the main text, we summarize the industries exhibiting
statistically meaningful patterns and report the corresponding estimates in
Table 7.
We first consider industries of particular national and policy relevance—
namely, major export-oriented sectors14) (column (1)) and high–greenhouse-
gas-emitting industries15) (column (2)). For these groups, ES ratings are, on
average, negatively associated with labor productivity, but the estimates are
not statistically significant. This may indicate that firms in these industries
have already adapted to ES-related practices to some extent, or that the
inherently high capital and technology intensity of these sectors makes the
incremental operating burdens associated with ES activities less salient in
measured productivity. Importantly, we do not find statistically significant
evidence that ES activities reduce labor productivity in the major export-
oriented industries. From a policy perspective, this is a relatively encouraging
result, suggesting that strengthening ES practices need not necessarily
undermine external competitiveness in these key sectors.
In contrast, a more disaggregated view across manufacturing industries
reveals substantial cross-industry heterogeneity in the ES–productivity
14) We define major export-oriented industries as the seven KSIC 2-digit industries that
correspond to Korea’s 15 leading export items identified by the Ministry of Trade, Industry
and Energy (2024): KSIC codes 20, 23, 24, 26, 28, 30, and 31.

32), ES ratings exhibit a pronounced negative association with labor
productivity. These findings suggest that environmental and social initiatives
may translate into more immediate operational burdens in these industries—
through production-process adjustments, higher operating costs, or
compliance-related expenditures. The adverse association may be particularly
notable in sectors where environmental regulation or workplace safety and
labor standards entail substantial implementation and monitoring costs.
Overall, the industry-level evidence indicates that the average negative
ES–productivity association documented in the full sample does not apply
uniformly across manufacturing industries. Instead, the relationship varies
meaningfully with industry-specific technological conditions, capital intensity,
and regulatory environments. This underscores the importance of interpreting
the economic implications of ESG activities in an industry context and
suggests that effective ESG-related policy design and corporate strategy
should take such cross-industry differences into account.

V. Conclusion
This study empirically examines the relationship between firms’
environmental (E) and social (S) performance—measured using KCGS
indicators—and labor productivity. We construct a panel of listed firms
over 2015–2023 and estimate panel regression models that include standard
firm-level controls as well as industry and year fixed effects. Our empirical
analyses encompass baseline specifications, mechanism-oriented evidence, and
heterogeneity tests across firms and industries.
Empirically, we find that ES ratings and ES scores are significantly
negatively associated with labor productivity in the full sample—an
association that contrasts with simple, unconditional comparisons that do not
account for firm size. The results indicate that once key firm characteristics
such as size, wage levels, and capital intensity are controlled for, ES
activities may be linked to lower, rather than higher, short-run productivity,
potentially reflecting operating burdens or implementation frictions. The
negative association is also observed when using the overall ESG rating and
the individual E, S, and G ratings, supporting the robustness of the baseline
finding. Mechanism-oriented analyses provide complementary evidence. Firms
with higher ES performance exhibit a higher total operating cost ratio (TOCR),
and the negative ES coeffcient becomes statistically insignificant once TOCR
is included, suggesting that the ES–productivity relationship may be closely
related to firms’ operating cost burden. Subcategory analyses further reveal
meaningful heterogeneity within E and S activities. On the environmental
side, subcomponents related to operational management and stakeholder
engagement are consistently negatively associated with productivity, whereas
on the social side, community engagement shows a positive association.
Taken together, these findings are consistent with the coexistence of a cost-
burden channel and a relational-capital channel within ES activities. We also
document heterogeneity across firms and industries. In firm-level interaction
specifications, the negative ES–productivity association is partially attenuated
under certain financial conditions—most notably among firms with higher

leverage or stronger profitability—implying that the ES effect can vary
with firms’ financial capacity. Industry-level analyses likewise show that the
negative association is pronounced in some manufacturing industries, while
it is not statistically significant in major export-oriented sectors or high–
greenhouse-gas-emitting industries.
These empirical findings suggest that the impacts of ES activities on labor
productivity are not straightforward and yield several policy and managerial
implications. First, ES initiatives should be interpreted through a long-
horizon perspective of value creation and risk management rather than as
instruments for immediate productivity improvement. Accordingly, relying
solely on short-run productivity measures provides an incomplete assessment
of the economic relevance of ES activities. Second, the mechanism-oriented
evidence indicates that ES engagement can entail short-run operating burdens
and that the effects on labor productivity may differ across activity types.
This underscores the need to move beyond an exclusive focus on aggregate
ES scores and to manage ES efforts with explicit attention to cost structures
and the composition of activities. Third, because the ES–productivity
relationship varies with firm characteristics and industry-specific cost and
regulatory environments, uniform ES policies or regulatory approaches
may be undesirable. Industry-tailored policies are particularly relevant
where production processes and environmental regulatory frameworks differ
substantially across sectors. Notably, we do not find statistically significant
evidence of adverse effects in major export-oriented manufacturing industries,
suggesting that strengthening ES practices need not necessarily undermine
external competitiveness—an important consideration for future sustainability
policy design.
Our analysis focuses on short-run labor productivity, whereas ES activities
may exert their influence through longer-run outcomes such as innovation,
resilience, and financial stability. In addition, our labor productivity measures
are based on value added (or sales) per employee and therefore may not fully
capture variation in hours worked or changes in labor quality. Future research
could therefore incorporate longer horizons and a broader set of performance

measures, including productivity metrics that better reflect labor input
intensity and quality. Moreover, macro-level conditions—such as industry
technology regimes and regulatory institutions—may interact with ES
engagement. A multi-layered framework that jointly considers firm behavior
and the industry- and country-level institutional environment would be a
fruitful direction for further work.

ES 활동과 노동생산성: 한국 제조업 사례
정성준*, 유복근**
본 연구는 KCGS(Korea Corporate Governance Service)가 제공하는 환경
(E) 및 사회(S) 지표를 활용하여 기업의 ES 활동이 노동생산성에 미치는 영향을 실
증적으로 분석한다. 2015~2023년 상장기업 패널자료를 이용한 분석 결과, ES 등
급과 ES 점수 모두 노동생산성과 유의한 음(-)의 관계를 보였으며, 이러한 결과는
ESG 종합등급이나 E·S 개별 등급을 사용한 경우에도 강건하게 유지되었다. 나아
가 본 연구는 비용 부담 경로와 정합적인 채널 증거를 제시한다. ES 수준이 높은 기
업일수록 총영업비용률(TOCR)이 높게 나타나, ES-생산성 관계가 운영비용 압박
과 연관되어 있음을 시사한다. 하위지표 분석에서는 ES 내부의 이질적 경로가 확인
된다. 환경(E) 부문에서는 운영·관리 및 커뮤니케이션 중심 활동이 노동생산성과
음(-)의 관계를 보여, 조정 및 관리 비용 증가와 부합하는 결과를 나타낸다. 반면 사
회(S) 부문의 지역사회 참여는 노동생산성과 양(+)의 관계를 보이며, 신뢰, 평판,
관계자본을 통한 보완적 경로가 존재함을 시사한다. 마지막으로 기업 수준 및 산업
수준 분석은 ES-생산성 관계가 기업과 산업 간에 상당한 이질성을 보임을 보여준
다. 종합하면, 본 연구는 비용 기반 채널 증거, 하위지표 분해, 이질성 분석을 결합
함으로써 지속가능경영의 경제적 함의를 평가할 때 총합 ES/ESG 지표뿐 아니라 비
용 구조, 활동 유형, 기업 및 산업 특성을 함께 고려할 필요가 있음을 강조한다.
